🖼️ Simple Image Segmentation
This project uses Python to automatically find and highlight objects in an image. It takes a normal photo and creates a "mask" that colors in different parts (like people, cars, or trees).

💡 What it does
Reads an image from your computer.

Analyzes pixels to find different shapes and objects.

Creates a report showing the original image next to the segmented version.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python: The main language.

OpenCV: For loading and changing images.

Matplotlib: To show the final visual results.

NumPy: To handle the math behind the pixels.
